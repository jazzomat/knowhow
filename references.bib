  abstract =  {The jazz improvisations of trumpeter Terence Blanchard (b. 1962) are examined to define his improvisational style through the analysis of transcribed solos of his recordings. Chapter One explains why Blanchard was chosen as the subject of this study and gives a brief overview of his life and career. Chapter Two reviews the literature that relates to Blanchard's life and career and literature that relates to analysis of jazz improvisation or defining an improvisational style. Chapter Three sets out the methodology for this study and explains that it is limited to his work as a leader from 1992 to 2008 and excludes his film scores. Chapter Four attempts to identify those aspects of his improvisation which occur repeatedly in his solos harmonically, rhythmically, melodically, and his use of special techniques. Short excerpts from his solos are used as documentation examples. Having stated the characteristics that circumscribe Mr. Blanchard's style, in Chapter Five suggestions are made as to what skills a student must develop in order to play in this style. Application is directed both to trumpet pedagogy and jazz pedagogy. Appendices include a complete discography of Mr. Blanchard's recorded work to date, and an interview of Mr. Blanchard answering questions directly related to this research.},

In particular, we seek to identify unknown jazz trumpeters. We plan to take an approach that has not received recent attention; namely, using human observation to compare spectrograms and other data representing musical timbre. We believe that human observation, when combined with machine learning, will improve accuracy of timbre recognition and performer identification. We will collect 100 music samples: five each from 20 trumpeters. We will manually sort spectrograms and other data in order to distinguish the most salient timbre characteristics. Once we choose those features, we will use a computer to filter for them. If our approach is successful, we will develop a larger database of trumpet solos.},

  abstract =  {Jazz harmony relies heavily on a set of well-defined harmonic patterns that evolved gradually throughout the 20th century. While certain tonally-oriented progressions such as the "ii-V-I" appear to be nearly ubiquitous across timeperiods, the jazz tradition also includes a notable departure from tonal harmony: the rise of modal jazz in the late 1950s. We aimed to systematically investigate the history of jazz composition by describing the evolution of chordal syntax, as well as the sort of organizational frameworks that might be described as harmonic schemata. In this study, we empirically describe the most common chords and chord motions of the jazz canon, and trace their evolution over time. Additionally, we describe an attempt to account for one particularly well-known compositional schema: the so-called "rhythm changes." In so doing, we make use of a recently compiled database of harmonic progressions for more than 1,160 jazz standards, encoded into the Humdrum "kern" format (Huron 1995). The present study provides details of corpus validation, and presents an initial descriptive characterization of the data set. Furthermore, we present evidence consistent with the hypothesis that chord sequences using tonal harmonic syntax became progressively less common from 1925 to 1970. Finally, we characterize the decline in popularity of one harmonic schema: the so-called "rhythm changes."},
